# DtdlEditor

A general-purpose editor inspired by [Azure IoT Central's model editor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/howto-set-up-template). 

Currently working on supporting [DTDLv2](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.

This Angular project uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS and `npm`.

2. Install Angular globally:

        `npm install -g @angular/cli`

3. Install reflect-metadata:

        `npm install reflect-metadata`

4. Install npm packages:

        `npm update`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
